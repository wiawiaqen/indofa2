# INDOFA - node.js and angular version
Indofa, an esteemed multinational organization established by the visionary trio from the Weow team, namely Nguỹn Ngĩa, Thý Hìn, and Nguỹn Nki, marked its inception in 2022. Demonstrating robust growth, in just one year, the team was further strengthened with the addition of two seasoned experts, Mei and Nga.

Originally architected using Django, a Python-based web framework, our development team conducted an extensive analysis and identified that Django's ORM methodology presented limitations when integrated with MongoDB. With a focus on enhancing our technological framework and scalability, Indofa has made a strategic pivot to a more cohesive stack comprising Node.js and Angular, paired seamlessly with MongoDB.

## Initiating the Client Server with Angular
To deploy the Angular application, execute the command below:
```bash
cd client
ng serve --open
```
This initiates the client server, opening the application in your default web browser automatically.
## Launching the Backend Server
To initiate the backend server, please follow these instructions:
```bash
cd server
npm i
npm start
```
Upon execution, these commands will install the necessary dependencies and start the backend server, thus activating the full suite of services.

We continue to strive for technical excellence and operational efficiency, and this transition to Node.js and Angular signifies our commitment to providing cutting-edge solutions to our clients.
